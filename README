# âœ¨ JS Quality Activity âœ¨

Let's practice tidying some messy code. This code prints a list of names and then checks that exactly two inputs match the expected number.

### ğŸ—º Instructions

ğŸ‘‰ Run `npm start`. You'll see the list of names printed to the console. Notice that the code is currently failing.

ğŸ‘‰ Read `/src/index.js`

ğŸ‘‰ Together with your partner, tidy the code up until the marker saying "â›” STOP".

ğŸ‘‰ Aim to make the code more readable, clean, and data-driven.

ğŸ‘‰ You should also fix the bug somewhere in lines 0-40 which is causing the code to fail.

ğŸ‘‰ When you're finished, the section after the "â›” STOP" marker should be unaltered. Running `npm start` should list all the names just like before, and then show a "âœ… SUCCESS" message.

ğŸ™Œ Happy coding!
